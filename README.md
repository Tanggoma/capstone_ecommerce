## Getting Started: 
#### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
  git clone [your-repository-url]
```

#### 2. Navigate into the project directory:
```bash
  cd [your-repository-name]
```

#### 3. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
  npm install
```

#### 4. Start the development server:
```bash
  npm run dev
```

## Deployment Instructions: 
#### 1. Build the application for production:
```bash
  npm run build
```

#### 2. To start the server:
```bash
  npm start
```

#### 3. Deploying to heroku: 
After create a new Heroku application, make sure you have the Heroku CLI installed and you're logged in. 
```bash
  git push heroku main
```

After pushing, Heroku will automatically detect a Node.js app and start building your app. The heroku-postbuild script ensures the app is built on Heroku post the push.
Once the build is done, you can open your app with:
```bash
  heroku open
```

### For Local Development: 

### In src > api > index.js
- Change BASE_URL for local development 

### In index.js
- Change cors origins to localhost 
- Uncomment 
```bash
# app.use(session({
#      secret: 'secret-key',
#      resave: false,
#      saveUninitialized: true,     // ** use True for both local and dev
#      cookie: {
#          secure: true, //false for local **
#          maxAge: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000,
#          sameSite: 'lax', //for deploy
#          httpOnly: true,
#      }, // Set secure to true later for deploy using https. For local development, use false. **
#      genid: (req) => {
#          return uuidv4(); // Use UUIDs for session IDs
#      }
